; PlatformIO configuration for the MiniLabo project
; This file defines the board, framework and dependencies required to
; compile the firmware for an ESP8266 based development board.  The
; firmware uses the Arduino framework, the ESP Async WebServer library
; to serve a responsive web user interface, U8g2 for the OLED display
; and ArduinoJson to parse and emit JSON configuration files.
